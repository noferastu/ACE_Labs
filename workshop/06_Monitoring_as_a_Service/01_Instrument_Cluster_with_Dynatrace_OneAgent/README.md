# Instrument Kubernetes Cluster with Dynatrace OneAgent Operator

In this lab you'll instrument the Kubernetes Cluster (from *Building Environment zero*) with Dynatrace OneAgent, which automatically monitors all your processes, containers, services, applications, and end-users. For more information about the OneAgent Operator and how it works, please follow this [link](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/full-stack/what-is-oneagent-operator/). 

Note: If you have already deployed the OneAgent during the Monolith to Microservices lab then this lab is not required
