# Developing Microservices 

In this module you will learn more about the structure of a microservice from a code perspective. Besides, this module explains some artifacts for containerizing the service and specifying its continuous integration pipeline. 

To get familiar with the carts service, you will:
* Deep dive into the carts service from a code perspective: [Lab](./01_Deep_Dive_into_Carts_Service)
* Commit a change of carts and re-deploy it to the dev environment: [Lab](./02_Deploy_Microservice_to_Dev)
* Create a release branch to trigger the pipeline for the staging environment: [Lab](./03_Deploy_Microservice_to_Staging)

# Prerequisites
